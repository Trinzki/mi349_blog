                <h2> About the Author, Cynthia Trocinski </h2>
                <p> 
                    Cynthia Trocinski is a senior studying Computer Science at Michigan State University, who is always looking for new ways to enjoy each season.<br>
                    Although summer for beach weather is her favorite season, she is beginning to see the beauty in Fall and Winter as well. <br>
                    Never a fan of being cold, she loves to cuddle up on the couch with a warm beverage and play video games when not doing homework.
                    Otherwise, when she has the clothing for embracing the colder weather, you can find her camping during fall to see all of the beautiful tree colors, 
                    at the MSU football games, or falling on her face attempting to snowboard in Winter.
