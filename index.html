                <h2> Falling for Fall </h2>
                <p> Fall for many is a season of excitement for spooky adventures, cornmazes, and everything pumpkin spice.
                    For others though, it's a season of dread for the oncoming numb fingers, runny noses, and colder weather to come. <br>
                    If you find yourself agreeing with the latter, it's time to find the joy in the Autumn season and <i>Fall for Fall</i>.
                    Some things you can do to begin to change your demeanor towards this season, is to find specific activites or foods that help you appreciate this time of year more.
                    This can be hopping on the bandwagon for pumpkin flavored everything. Pumpkin bread, pumpkin cookies, pumpkin coffee... you name it. Or maybe it's finding
                    your own food that you make more often during the Autumn time - like a warm pumpkin soup or apple desserts. <br>
                    You can also look into activites that might make the season a bit more fun.
                    Check out those corn mazes you hear a lot about. Take some time and check out new video games to play that are more Halloween themed while cozied up in a blanket. Plan a camping trip to take hikes and walks in the gorgeous colored trees and have an excuse to eat s'mores by the fire.
                    You can also go apple picking or to a haunted house, or, if your more of a homebody, stay home with some popcorn, wine, and a fun halloween movie. 
                    For the month of November, in honor of Thanksgiving if you celebrate it, maybe make a 'Thankful Pumpkin' where everyday you write something that you are thankful for on it. <br>
                    Whether it be an activity or food, it is super important to find something that
                    makes you happy, so you don't dread the inevitable season.

                <h3> Weathering Winter </h3>
                <p> Winter wonderland is a saying heard quite often, and it is usually pictured with a pristine and peaceful scenery covered by a beautiful snowfall. 
                    A lot of people think of this saying when looking forward to Winter. For others though - yellow snow, dangerous roads, longer commute times, and constant wet clothes
                    is what comes to their minds instead. <br>
                    If you find yourself thinking more like the latter, then it's high time to discover some things about Winter that allow you to enjoy it as much as possible in spite of its drawbacks.
                    Winter is a time for warm and cozy food and drinks. On a more colder day, make something warm and filling for dinner. 
                    One of my favorites is Broccoli Cheddar soup with potato and bacon. Broccoli cheddar soup is already nice and warm, but with the potato and bacon, it is incredibly savory
                    and seems to keep the warmth in the body for a longer period of time. <br>
                    Maybe focus on the Holidays during this time! Christmas and other holidays are right around the corner! Start planning what you're going to do to celebrate and get excited for them!
                    Otherwise if those holidays aren't your thing, make plans to take advantage of the snow. Take advantage of the snow? What do I mean by that?
                    I mean embrace it. Make sure to have some nice warm clothing, and then get out there and learn a winter activity! This can be tubing at those places where
                    you don't have to walk back up, it can be snowboarding or skiing, or even ice skating.
                    If you don't know how to do any of these, maybe it's time to try and learn.
                    Already mentioned once, but worth mentioning again, make sure to have warm clothing if possible. This time of year is so much more enjoyable when not shivering from your head to toes. <br>
                    Otherwise if you're not a huge outdoorsy person or don't have the ability to get warm enough clothing, now is the perfect time to do that movie marathon you've been thinking about for a while.
                    You also have the perfect reason to try out that new video game you've been wanting to play for a while, or even just watch a bunch of holiday themed movies.
                    Another idea is to get into knitting! Not much is more satisfying than cuddling with your own handmade blanket. <br>
                    Winter is a time where the cold and lack of sun can become incredibly overbearing and depressing. This is why it is so incredibly important to find something that makes you happy, and makes the cold weather bearable until warmer weather comes around.
