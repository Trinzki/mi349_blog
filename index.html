                <h2> Falling for Fall </h2>
                <p> Fall for many is season of excitement for Spooky adventures, cornmazes, and everything pumpkin spize.
                    For others though it's a season of dread for the numb fingers, runny noses, and colder weather. <br>
                    If you find yourself agreeing with the latter, it's time to find the joy in the Autumn season and Fall for Fall.
                    Some things you can do to begin to change your demeanor is to find specific activites or foods that help you appreciate this time of year.
                    This can be hopping on the bandwagon for pumpkin flavored everything. Pumpkin bread, pumpkin cookies, pumpkin coffee... you name it, or finding
                    your own food that you make only during the Autumn time like a warming soup and apple deserts. <br>
                    You can also look into activites that might make the season a bit more fun.
                    Check out those corn mazes you hear a lot about, maybe take some time and check out new video games to play cozied up in a blanket that have a more Spooky Air about them.
                    Go apple picking or to a haunted house, or stay home with some popcorn, wine, and a halloween movie. 
                    For November, in honor of Thanksgiving if you live in the US and celebrate it, maybe make a Thankful Pumpkin where everyday you write something that you are thankful for on it. <br>
                    Whether it be an activity, food, or food, it is super important to find something that
                    makes you happy so you don't dread the season.

                <h2> Weathering Winter </h2>
                <p> Winter wonderland is a saying heard quite often, and it is usually pictured with pristine and peaceful scenery covered by a beutiful snowfall. 
                    A lot of people think of this saying when looking forward to Winter. For others though, yellow snow, dangerous roads, longer commute times, and constant wet clothes
                    is what comes to their minds instead. <br>
                    If you find yourself thinking more like the latter, then it's high time to discover some things about Winter that allow you to enjoy it as much as possible, in spite of some of those negatives.
                    Winter is a time for warm and cozy food and drinks. On a more colder day, make something warm and filling for dinner. 
                    One of my favorites is Broccoli Cheddar soup with potatoe and bacon. It a nice warm soup, but with the potato and bacon, it is incredibly savoring
                    and seems to keep the warmth in the body for a longer period of time. <br>
                    Try to focus on the Holidays during this time! Christmas and other holidays are right around the corner! Start planning what you're going to do to celebrate and get excited for them!
                    Otherwise if those holidays aren't your thing, make plans to take advantage of the snow. Take advantage of the snow? What do I mean by that?
                    I mean to embrace it. Make sure to have some nice warm clothing, and then get out there and learn a winter activity! This can be tubing at those places where
                    you don't have to walk back up, it can be snowboarding or skiing, or even ice skating.
                    If you don't know how to do any of these, maybe it's time to try and learn.
                    Otherwise if you're not a huge outdoorsy person, now is the perfect time to do that movie marathon you've been thinking about for a while,
                    or try out that new video game that came out a while ago, or even just watch a bunch of Christmas movies.
                    Another idea is to get into knitting! Not much is more satisfying than cuddling with your own handmade blanket. <br>
                    Winter is a time where seasonal depression becomes rampant, so it is incredibly important to find something that makes you happy and makes the cold weather bearable during this time.
